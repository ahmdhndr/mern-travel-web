##Description
This project is a learning material from the [Full-Stack JavaScript Developer: Website Travel](https://buildwithangga.com/kelas/full-stack-javascript-developer-website-travel?thumbnail=SfYz9toaTN.34&main_leads=topics) online class provided by the [BuildWithAngga](https://buildwithangga.com/) website. The material in this class uses the MERN stack and includes UI/UX material.

##Key Points

- Learn to use the Reactjs library

- Learn to build APIs with Nodejs & Expressjs
- Learn to work with non-sequel DBs with mongodb
- Learn Usability-Testing by analyzing website user behavior

## Challenge

So far, the challenges I've faced are:

- In the learning video material, the mentor uses bootstrap as a CSS framework where I use MUI (Material UI) to create UI components with a combination of CSS3 and styles brought by MUI to produce an appearance similar to the design in Figma.
- In some component builds, mentor uses class-based components where I try to produce the same result using functional components.
